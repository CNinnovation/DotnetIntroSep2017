# Lab 3 - Delegates, Events, Lambdas

## Delegates and Lambdas

1. Create a .NET Framework Console Application
2. Create a list of Racer objects (or any object type you like with multiple properties)
3. Sort the list using the IComparable interface
4. Sort the list using the IComparer interface - create a specific compararer type
5. Sort the list using a Lambda expression with the Comparision type

## Events

1. Create a consumer class with a method to subscribe to an event, e.g. class Consumer
2. Create a producer class offering an event, e.g. class CarFactory
3. Fire the event from the producer class, e.g. CreateACar
4. Subscribe to the event from a consumer
